# AndroidComponents

Putting out the custom components that  I build for my at-home development. 
All projects are licensed under the MIT license.

List of components:

1. PercentageCircleRelativeLayout - a custom view that draws a background circle and colored circle that shows a percentage. All you need to do is add it to your layout, and in your code get a reference to it and call showPercentDone(int percent). This will redraw the view with animation.

2. PercentageLineRelativeLayout - similar to the circle but a line instead. Still working on the implementation for this one.
